5. The Hawaiian spell-checker:

misspelled English words: 38
misspelled Hawaiian words: 405
words misspelled in English but not Hawaiian: 3 (hulau and kula)
words misspelled in Hawaiian but not English: 370 (able and right)

Spellchecker
Input a file.
tr -cs "A-Za-z" '[\n*]' | 
tr [:upper:] [:lower:] | 
sort -u | 
comm -23 - hwords
The line of commands mentioned earlier in the spec also functions as a 
English spell-checker. Just change hwords to words.

Crosschecking after spell-check
cat hmisspells | 
tr -cs "A-Za-z" '[\n*]' 
| tr [:upper:] [:lower:] 
| sort -u 
| comm -23 - words > hmecheck 
and then wc

Count the number of "misspelled" English and Hawaiian words on this web page, 
using your spelling checkers. Are there any words that are "misspelled" as 
English, but not as Hawaiian? or "misspelled" as Hawaiian but not as English? 
If so, give examples.
Counting with the wc command.
Virtually the entire doc is misspelled in Hawaiian (about 405 words). About 38 
words are misspelled in English. Basically all Hawaiian words that appear on 
the assignment spec (ie. hulau and kula) are misspelled as English but not 
Hawaiian. A large percentage of the words are misspelled in Hawaiian, but not 
in English (ie. able, right)
