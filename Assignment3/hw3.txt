Q1: case_long_iso_time_style was necesary to remove since it was the source
of the bug. This made the system output the undesired format.

Q2: The way the month is explicitly spelled out helps prevent confusion between
the month and the day. However, since the month is abbreviated in English,
those with absolutely no knowledge of English will not be able to read the
month, and thus the full date correctly.

Q3: python randline.py /dev/null
"IndexError: list index out of range" This occurs trying to draw a line from
an empty file, so there's an error in that.

Q4: (export PATH=/usr/local/cs/bin:$PATH needed to execute python3)
   File "randline.py", line 65
       except IOError as (errno, strerror):
                             ^
			     SyntaxError: invalid syntax
And this happens no matter what file you put in as input. This is because
randline.py is incompatible with python3 due to its syntax. In order to fix
this,
2to3 randline.py
will show the syntax corrections needed to make randline.py compatible with
python3. You can patch these corrections on through a pipe to create a file
that works with python3
