Install Coreutils 7.6
1. wget ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/coreutils/coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
2. tar –xzvf coreutils-7.6.tar.gz
3. mkdir coreutilsInstall
4. cd to the coreutils-7.6 directory
5. ./configure --prefix=/u/eng/class/classriv/Assignment3/temp/coreutilsInstall
put files in certain folder
6. make 
compiles the program to make a bunch of executable files
7. make install
installs program to make it available for use outside of the folder. 
copies the files over to the desired directory for use
(note make clean removes .o and executable files - cleans up all temporary and 
intermediate files. Essentially acts as an uninstall)

Redirect to the directory containing Coreutils and test their buggy ls
1. cd coreutilsInstall/bin
2. ./ls –l /bash/bin
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 941880 2015-12-22 01:12 /bin/bash

Apply the patch
1. cd coreutils-7.6/src (directory back to the source)
2. in the original patch code, copy the patch file into ls.diff
- copy patch online string after the note about the additions and subtractions
until the end --
3. patch < ls.diff (applies the patch to apply the outside file)
4. cd ..
5. ./configure 
--prefix=/u/eng/class/classriv/Assignment3/temp/coreutilsInstallFix
6. make
7. make install
*the prev 3 steps have the same reasons as the initial installation*

Testing new files, esp with a file at least a year old
1. cd back into the directory containing the buggy files temp/coreutilsInstall
2. ./ls –l /bin/bash still reads incorrectly
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 941880 2015-12-22 01:12 /bin/bash
3. cd into new directory containing patched files temp/coreutilsInstallFix
4. ./ls –l /bin/bash
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 941880 Dec 22  2015 /bin/bash
5. to test reading of old file: touch -t 201410121636 yes
6. ./ls -l 
-rwxr-xr-x 1 classriv class  72689 Oct 12  2014 yes
all output reads correctly
