File - log.txt - Describes steps taken in lab in order to able to 
reproduce your work later, if need be.

1. Set up Ubuntu
I had a bootable USB with Ubuntu installed, and I had to restart my computer in 
such a way to boot it from the USB. 

2. Install OpenSSH 
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-server
$ sudo apt-get install openssh-client

3. Setup Server
a. generate keys
$ ssh-keygen
And I used the defualt location

The password (public key) is: dank

Emacs is not installed so I installed it using:
$ sudo apt-get install emacs

b. find out ip address
$ ifconfig

10.97.85.178

James:
10.97.85.160

Jehu:
10.97.85.177

Disable password-based authentication:
$ sudo emacs /etc/ssh/sshd_config

4. Setup Clients Account

For James:
$ sudo useradd -d /home/james -m james
$ sudo passwd james
$ sudo mkdir /home/james/.ssh
$ cd /home/james
$ sudo chown -R james .ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

For Jehu:
$ sudo useradd -d /home/jehu -m jehu
$ sudo passwd jehu
$ sudo mkdir /home/jehu/.ssh
$ cd /home/jehu
$ sudo chown -R jehu .ssh
$ sudo chmod 700 .ssh

For me:
James and Jehu added me this way:
$ sudo useradd -d /home/crystal -m crystal
$ sudo passwd crystal

5. Test SSH for Password Authentication
James's host
$ ssh -X crystal@10.97.85.178
Then I typed
$ xterm

It popped up an xterm window.

It also works on Jehu's host.
Steps are the same except with a different IP address.

6. Setup key-based authentication
For James:
$ ssh-copy-id -i crystal@10.97.85.178
$ yes
Then I typped in my password to log in and exited.

$ ssh-add
I typped in the public key: dank

Then I did
$ ssh crystal@10.97.85.178
Then every time after this I can log in without typing anything.

Then I did
$ ssh -X crystal@10.97.85.178
$ xterm
An xterm shell window popped up.

And James checked using:
$ ps aux
He saw a daemon called xterm and the user is crystal

For Jehu's host, steps are the same except with a different IP address.
