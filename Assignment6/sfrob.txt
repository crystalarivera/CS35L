I only look at the sys times for comparison here. For a smaller file, 
sfrobu runs faster than sfrobs, but for larger files, sfrobs runs faster than 
sfrobu. For the larger files, the system calls by sfrobu definitely
slow down the process, and that's how sfrobs is able to run faster in 
comparison. In system calls, it is expensive due to the switching from
user mode to kernel mode.
